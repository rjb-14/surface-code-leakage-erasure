# surface-code-leakage-erasure

Simulation of static, walking, and moonwalking surface codes with **leakage** 
and **erasure checks**, 
built on [Stim](https://github.com/quantumlib/Stim) and a fork of 
PyMatching ([original](https://github.com/oscarhiggott/PyMatching); 
[fork](https://github.com/Allenator/PyMatching)).

Leakage events are sampled at circuit locations, directly modifying the circuit.
Erasure checks are used to decode by either a marginal (averaged) matching graph
or with a branch-and-bound search that respects the disjointness constraints between
leakage locations.

This is the code accompanying **"Erasure surface code circuit without
mid-circuit erasure checks"**, by Margaret Pavlovich, Ivan Rojkov, Chen Wang,
and Shruti Puri — arXiv:2608.XXXXX <TODO: arXiv URL>. 
<!-- See [Citation](#citation) below. -->

## Requirements

- **Python 3.10 or newer.**
- **A C++ toolchain.** The required PyMatching fork (see below) has no
  pre-built wheels, so pip compiles it from source. On macOS this means Xcode
  command line tools (`xcode-select --install`); on Linux, a recent `g++`.

Runtime dependencies, installed automatically:
`numpy`, `stim`, `sinter`, `joblib`, `pymatching` (fork!)

Plotting and data analysis (`analysis.py`, `plotting.py`) additionally need
`pandas`, `scipy`, and `matplotlib`. These are *not* required to run
simulations, so they live behind an optional `analysis` extra.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/magzpavz/surface-code-leakage-erasure.git
cd surface-code-leakage-erasure
pip install .
```

To include the analysis and plotting helpers:

```bash
pip install ".[analysis]"
```

For development, install in editable mode:

```bash
pip install -e ".[analysis]"
```

Expect the install to take a few minutes: pip clones and compiles the
PyMatching fork.

## Quickstart

```python
from surface_code_leakage_erasure import SurfaceCodeErasureSampler, SurfaceCodeLayout

sampler = SurfaceCodeErasureSampler(SurfaceCodeLayout(3), n_jobs=1)
result = sampler.sample_LER(
    rounds=4, p_Pauli=1e-3, p_leak=1e-3, min_samples=100,
)
print(result.num_samples, result.failures_marginal)
```

### Early-walking transversal CNOT

The dedicated builder below prepares two identical `swap_time="early"`
patches in the X basis, runs the requested syndrome-extraction rounds before
and after a transversal CX from patch 1 to patch 2, and then performs X
readout:

```python
from surface_code_leakage_erasure import EarlyWalkingTCNOTBuilder

builder = EarlyWalkingTCNOTBuilder(3, seed=0)
circuit, _ = builder.get_circuit(
    rounds_per_side=3,
    p=1e-3,
    Pauli_locations="2-qubit gates",
)
circuit.detector_error_model()  # verifies detector/observable determinism
```

`rounds_per_side` is the backwards-compatible symmetric form. To choose the
two sides independently, omit it and provide both keyword-only counts:

```python
circuit, _ = builder.get_circuit(
    rounds_before=0,
    rounds_after=3,
    p=1e-3,
)
```

Both counts must be non-negative integers, odd and even values are supported,
and only `rounds_before=rounds_after=0` is rejected. Thus both `0/N` and `N/0`
are valid for `N >= 1`. The builder places the tCNOT on the active walking
sublattice, closes the initial detector boundary specially for `0/N`, and
closes the final detector boundary across the tCNOT for `N/0`.

Observable 0 tracks the propagated control X logical
(`X_control * X_target`), and observable 1 tracks the target X logical.
Leakage injection and Tesseract decoding are described below; a dedicated tCNOT
sampler is intentionally deferred.

For a logical Bell-correlation experiment, use the mixed-preparation builder.
It initializes the control patch in the X basis and the target patch in the Z
basis. The `basis` argument selects the common final readout basis and the one
tracked correlation observable:

```python
from surface_code_leakage_erasure import EarlyWalkingTCNOTBellBuilder

builder = EarlyWalkingTCNOTBellBuilder(3, seed=0)

xx_circuit, _ = builder.get_circuit(
    rounds_per_side=3,
    p=1e-3,
    basis="X",  # Observable 0 is X_L1 * X_L2.
)
zz_circuit, _ = builder.get_circuit(
    rounds_per_side=3,
    p=1e-3,
    basis="Z",  # Observable 0 is Z_L1 * Z_L2.
)

assert xx_circuit.num_observables == 1
assert zz_circuit.num_observables == 1
```

The XX and ZZ correlations require separate circuits because the final data
measurements use incompatible bases.

### The PyMatching fork

**This package will not work with PyMatching from PyPI.**

Erasure decoding reweights the matching graph on every shot, passing the
per-shot weights through the `edge_reweights` argument of `Matching.decode`
and `Matching.decode_to_edges_array`. Upstream PyMatching does not implement
this, so `Matching.decode` absorbs and silently discards the kwarg (`Matching.decode_to_edges_array` raises a TypeError). Marginal decoding 
then runs to completion while ignoring every erasure check, yielding 
plausible-looking but meaningless logical error rates.

The required fork is
[`Allenator/PyMatching`](https://github.com/Allenator/PyMatching), which
implements `edge_reweights` on both methods.

`pip install .` pulls the fork in automatically — it is declared as a direct
reference in `pyproject.toml`, so no extra step is needed in a clean
environment. **If you already have upstream PyMatching installed**, pip may
consider the requirement satisfied and keep it. Replace it explicitly:

```bash
pip install --force-reinstall \
  "pymatching @ git+https://github.com/Allenator/PyMatching.git"
```

Because both builds report version `2.4.0`, a version specifier cannot
distinguish them; the direct URL is the only way to select the fork.

As a safeguard, the package checks for this capability when you construct a
`SurfaceCodeErasureSampler` or an `ErasureDecoder`, and raises a `RuntimeError`
with installation instructions if the installed PyMatching cannot honor
`edge_reweights`. You can query it directly:

```python
from surface_code_leakage_erasure.decoding import pymatching_supports_edge_reweights
assert pymatching_supports_edge_reweights()
```

## Concepts

A simulation is assembled from four pieces:

| Piece | Classes | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Layout** | `SurfaceCodeLayout`, `WalkingSurfaceCodeLayout` | Qubit coordinates, plaquettes, gate order, logical operators. Built once per distance; construction is slow, so reuse it. `WalkingSurfaceCodeLayout` takes a `swap_time` argument selecting the walking or moonwalking circuit — see [Layout parameters](#layout-parameters). |
| **Circuit builder** | `SurfaceCodeCircuitBuilder`, `WalkingSCCircuitBuilder` | Turns a layout into a stim circuit for a given round count and noise model, and reports which erasure checks fired. |
| **Decoder** | `ErasureDecoder` | Builds detector error models for leakage events and decodes syndromes. |
| **Sampler** | `SurfaceCodeErasureSampler` | Drives the whole loop and estimates logical failure probability. |

## Parameter reference

### Layout parameters

Passed to the layout constructor, not to `sample_LER`. `SurfaceCodeLayout`
takes only the code distance `d`; `WalkingSurfaceCodeLayout` additionally takes
`swap_time`, which selects which of the two circuits from the paper is built.

| Parameter | Values | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `d` | — | Code distance. Must be odd for the walking layouts. |
| `swap_time` | `"late"`, `"early"` | `"late"` builds the conventional **walking** surface code; `"early"` builds the **moonwalking** surface code.  |

The layout carries its `swap_time` with it, so a builder or sampler constructed
from a layout inherits it — you do not pass it again. `WalkingSCCircuitBuilder`
accepts `swap_time` directly only when given a bare distance instead of a
layout.

### Circuit parameters

Passed as keyword arguments to `sample_LER`, (and to
`CircuitBuilder.get_circuit`, etc.). Defaults are the first value listed.

| Parameter | Values | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `basis` | `"Z"`, `"X"` | Basis in which the logical qubit is prepared and measured. |
| `ec_sched` | `8`, `4`, `2`, `1` | How often erasure checks run. `8` = ancillas only, during stabilizer measurement; `4` = all qubits, during stabilizer measurement; `2` = all qubits every other step; `1` = all qubits every step. When using EC schedule 8 with the static surface code, a leakage-SWAP is applied between each data qubit and a neighboring ancilla (requiring extra ancillas) at the beginning of each syndrome extraction round. |
| `Pauli_locations` | `"2-qubit gates"`, `"gates"`, `"all"` | Where Pauli noise is applied. Pauli noise is always applied after gates. `"gates"` includes reset, measurement, and Hadamards; `"all"` adds idling locations. |
| `leak_locations` | `"2-qubit gates"`, `"all"` | Where leakage may occur. Leakage is always applied before gates. `"all"` lets idling qubits leak too. |
| `leak_effect` | see below | What a leaked qubit does to its gate partner. |

`leak_effect` selects the leaked-qubit effect:

| Value | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `"depolarize"` | Gate still applied; the partner of a leaked qubit is fully depolarized (p = 3/4). |
| `"tailored"` | Gate still applied; the partner gets an X error (p = 1/2) if it is the target, or a Z error (p = 1/2) if it is the control. |
| `"skip gates"` | Any gate involving a leaked qubit is removed; neither qubit receives an error. |
| `"tailored then skip"` | On the step where a qubit first leaks, its partner gets the `"tailored"` error; on later steps the gate is skipped. |

Two further values, `"decode skip gates"` and `"decode tailored then skip"`,
are the decoding counterparts (Pauli envelopes) of the two skipping models. 
A skipped gate is a Clifford error and has no
representation in a stim detector error model, so for decoding it is replaced by
a depolarizing channel on the leaked qubit at appropriate circuit locations (see paper). 
These are substituted automatically when detector error models are built — pass 
`"skip gates"` or `"tailored then skip"` and let the decoder handle it.

### Sampling parameters

| Parameter | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rounds` | — | Number of error correction rounds. Must be even for the walking circuits. |
| `p_Pauli` | — | Physical Pauli error rate. |
| `p_leak` | — | Leakage probability per leakage location. |
| `min_samples` | — | Lower bound on shots taken. |
| `target_failure_count` | `0` | If > 0, a preliminary run estimates the number of shots needed to observe this many failures, clamped to `[min_samples, max_samples]`. `0` takes exactly `min_samples`. |
| `max_samples` | `1_000_000` | Upper bound on shots taken. |
| `use_branch_and_bound` | `False` | Also decode with the branch-and-bound search and report it as the MLE result. Only differs from the marginal result when `leak_effect` skips gates. |
| `mle_time_limit` | `1` | Per-shot budget in seconds for that search. `None` for no limit. |
| `time_limit_hours` | `None` | Stop after this many hours and return what was collected. |
| `deadline` | `None` | The same, as an absolute `time.time()` value. Wins if both are given. |
| `n_leak` | `None` | Give every shot exactly this many leakage locations instead of sampling at rate `p_leak`. Forces `p_Pauli = 0`. |
| `verbose` | `False` | Print progress. |

- **Marginal vs. branch-and-bound decoding** — a fired erasure check does not
  say *when* the qubit leaked, only that it did. Marginal decoding averages
  the detector error models (Pauli envelopes) over every leakage location consistent with the
  check. Branch-and-bound decoding instead searches for a solution in which
  the chosen Pauli errors are consistent with leakage location disjointness, which matters when
  leaked qubits cause gates to be skipped. `sample_LER` reports the marginal
  result always, and the branch-and-bound result when
  `use_branch_and_bound=True`.

`sample_LER` returns an `ErasureSamplerResult`, whose `pfail_marginal` and
`pfail_MLE` fields are `sinter` fit objects carrying `.best`, `.low`, and
`.high`. `pfail_MLE` is `None` unless `use_branch_and_bound=True`.

> **`pfail` is not the LER.** These fields are the probability that a *whole
> shot* fails — `failures / num_samples` — not a per-round rate. To get a
> logical error rate per round, divide by `rounds`. 

## Early-walking transversal CNOT leakage decoding

The original early-walking tCNOT builder uses two X-initialized patches, one
transversal physical CX, and two tracked X logical observables. The Bell builder
uses X/Z initialization and one tracked XX or ZZ correlation. Leakage at the
transversal layer is represented by `builder.TCX_STEP`; it is detected by the
next check selected by `ec_sched`, or by final data readout when the tCNOT is
the final boundary.

Install the optional hypergraph decoder with `pip install -e ".[tesseract]"`.
The decoder keeps each undecomposed Stim error mechanism as a full hyperedge,
including its logical-observable effects. It accepts both the original
two-observable builder and the one-observable Bell builder. Its round arguments
must match the builder: use either `rounds_per_side`, or both `rounds_before`
and `rounds_after`.

```python
import stim
from tesseract_decoder import tesseract
from surface_code_leakage_erasure import (
    EarlyWalkingTCNOTBuilder,
    EarlyWalkingTCNOTDecoder,
    TesseractHyperedgeDecoder,
)

rounds_per_side = 2
builder = EarlyWalkingTCNOTBuilder(3, seed=0)
builder.get_circuit(rounds_per_side, 0)
leaked_qubit = builder._transversal_pairs()[0][0]

# The physical circuit really skips gates involving the leaked qubit.
physical, erasure_checks = builder.get_circuit(
    rounds_per_side,
    1e-3,
    leakage_circuit_locations={
        rounds_per_side: {builder.TCX_STEP: {leaked_qubit}}
    },
    ec_sched=4,
    leak_effect="skip gates",
    use_cache=False,
)

simulator = stim.FlipSimulator(batch_size=1, seed=1)
simulator.do(physical)
syndrome = simulator.get_detector_flips(bit_packed=False)[:, 0]

backend = TesseractHyperedgeDecoder(
    det_beam=tesseract.INF_DET_BEAM,
)
decoder = EarlyWalkingTCNOTDecoder(
    builder,
    rounds_per_side,
    p_pauli=1e-3,
    hyperedge_decoder=backend,
    circuit_kwargs={"ec_sched": 4, "leak_effect": "skip gates"},
)

# Shape (2,): propagated control-X observable, then target-X observable.
prediction = decoder.decode(syndrome, erasure_checks)

# Quasi-MLE returns (marginal_prediction, valid_prediction_or_none).
marginal, valid = decoder.decode(
    syndrome,
    erasure_checks,
    decoder_strategy="quasi_mle",
    decoder_args={"max_nodes": 256, "mle_time_limit": 1.0},
)
```

The physical skip-gate circuit is for sampling. The decoder independently
rebuilds its corresponding Pauli-envelope circuit; it never requests graphlike
DEM decomposition.

## Known issues

**Sampling is not seedable end-to-end.** `SurfaceCodeErasureSampler` exposes no
seed: each joblib worker builds its own `SurfaceCodeCircuitBuilder(layout)` with
`seed=None`, and one leakage-sampling site in
[`erasure_sampler.py`](src/surface_code_leakage_erasure/erasure_sampler.py) draws
from the global `np.random.random()` rather than from a passed generator. As a
result individual runs cannot be reproduced exactly, only statistically. 

**There are no tests.** The repository ships no test suite, sorry!
